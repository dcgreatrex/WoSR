Second section: Weigth lifting Exercises dataset.

Training and test splits of the dataset have already been created, they are in the repo as csv files.
The R file is a quick trial of a couple of ML algorythms. 
Plan is to implement it in Python, and add sufficient amount of data exploration and plotting too.
